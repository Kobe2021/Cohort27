# Project 1


## Description
This game simply matches uno cards. There is a collection of uno cards in which the player and the computer are given randomly. The player with the card that has the highest value, wins the match. If you win the match, the screen turns red. If the computer wins the match, the computer turns blue. If your card and the computer's card have the same value, it is a tie and the screen turns grey.

To play, click start game and two random uno cards will be drawn. One is your card, and the other is the computer's card. When you hit the reset button, the screen goes back to white, and the game restarts.

Data for the cards are stored in an array of objects, where each object represents a different uno card. Each object has properties of a certain uno card.
